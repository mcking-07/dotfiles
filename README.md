# dotfiles
This repository contains my personal dotfiles for setting up a unix-like environment.

## Installation
To install these dotfiles on your system, you can use the following steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/mcking-07/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

The installation script will copy the dotfiles to your home directory and create symbolic links to them. Note that this will overwrite any existing dotfiles in your home directory.

## Usage
These dotfiles are designed to work with a unix-like environment, such as macOS or Linux. Once installed, you can customize the dotfiles to your liking. Some common customizations include adding aliases, setting environment variables, and configuring applications.
